Fashion Recommender System

Overview

This project introduces a sophisticated fashion recommendation system utilizing deep learning and computer vision techniques. By leveraging the ResNet-50 convolutional neural network architecture, the system analyzes fashion images to extract meaningful features and provide personalized fashion recommendations.


Features

Deep Learning Model: Uses the ResNet-50 model for robust feature extraction from fashion images.
Recommendation Engine: Implements K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) to find and recommend similar fashion items based on user input.
User Interface: A Streamlit-based web interface that allows users to upload images or provide URLs to fashion items and receive recommendations.
High Performance: Achieved an F1 score of 0.92 on validation data, indicating a high level of precision and recall in the recommendations.

Technical Stack

Languages: Python
Frameworks/Libraries: Streamlit, TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy, Scikit-learn
Tools: Git for version control
